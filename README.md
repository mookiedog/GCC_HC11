# GCC Toolchain for 68HC11 Development on Windows

GCC support for the Motorola 68HC11 has been obsolete since the early 2000's timeframe. I found it difficult to find
a working Windows 68HC11 toolchain without resorting to using the [Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) to resolve dead links on the web pages that still reference installers.

To save other people time, this repository contains a Windows installer for the gnu-68hc1x-3.1 toolchain. This is the most up-to-date version of the toolchain that I could find.

To get the toolchain, clone the repository or download it as a zip file, then run the installer to extract the toolchain onto your machine.
